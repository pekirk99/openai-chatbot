# Console-Based Chatbot with OpenAI's API

## Overview

This project is a simple console-based chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model. It demonstrates how to integrate with OpenAI's API, manage sensitive API keys securely, and build a conversational interface using Python. The chatbot interacts with users in real-time, responding to their queries through OpenAI's language model.

## Features

- **Real-time Conversations:**
  - The chatbot allows users to have real-time text-based interactions directly from the console.

- **Secure API Key Management:**
  - API keys are stored in a `config.json` file, keeping sensitive information separate from the codebase.

- **Modular Design:**
  - Functions are designed for easy reuse and extension, including separate modules for configuration loading and API interaction.

- **User-Friendly Setup:**
  - Simple steps to configure and run the chatbot, making it beginner-friendly.

## Setup

1. **Obtain OpenAI API Key:**
   - Log in to your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/) and generate an API key.

2. **Create Configuration File:**
   - In the project directory, create a `config.json` file with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
         "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
     }
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure the required Python libraries are installed. Specifically, you need the `openai` library:
     ```bash
     pip install openai
     ```

4. **Run the Chatbot:**
   - Execute the main script to start the chatbot:
     ```bash
     python console_chatbot.py
     ```

## How It Works

1. **API Integration:**
   - The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model to process user input and generate responses.

2. **Configuration Management:**
   - The API key is securely loaded from the `config.json` file, avoiding hardcoding sensitive data into the script.

3. **Interactive Chat Loop:**
   - The script enters a loop, continuously taking user input, sending it to the API, and displaying the response.

## Why This Project Matters

- **Learn API Integration:**
  - This project provides a practical introduction to working with APIs and handling external dependencies in Python.

- **Build Real-World Applications:**
  - The chatbot serves as a foundational example for creating more complex conversational agents.

- **Promote Secure Practices:**
  - It emphasizes the importance of separating sensitive data from the codebase and adhering to secure development practices.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Functionality:**
  - Add support for saving conversation history or integrating with external data sources.

- **GUI Integration:**
  - Enhance the chatbot by building a graphical interface for improved user experience.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the chatbot as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.
